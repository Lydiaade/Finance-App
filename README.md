# Finance-App

This app is to replace my current financial manager which currently exists in Microsoft Excel.
Though this app does the job, I would ideally like to have an app that does it all for me and that can be updated to have much cooler features and maybe one day monetized. It will also allow me to learn more about how I handle my finances as well as practicing coding languages I don't use on a regular basis.
